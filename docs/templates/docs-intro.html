            Synthea is a free, customizable soundboard program designed for dynamic
            playback of sound effects, ambience, and music in unscripted
            performances. It was written for use in improvised theater, but
            is ideal for any live production where pre-programmed cues won't cut it.

    <div class="section-header">What Synthea Does</div>

    <div class="section-body">
        <p>
        Synthea creates soundboards for realtime playback of sound effects, ambience, and music. Its easy-to-use interface
        makes it an accessible solution to any live production, while its powerful
        features provide deep customization and precision for advanced users.
        </p>
        <p>Some key features include:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Convenient Queuing</strong></div>
            <i>Line up sound cues in advance to play back when you need them&mdash;
            on demand, sequentially, or all at once.</i></p>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Automatic Crossfading</strong></div>
            <i>When a sound cue is paused or stopped, Synthea automatically fades the sound out so you don't have to think about
            it. With realtime board switches and cue-specific settings,
            you can choose on-the-fly whether new cues fade in or start at full volume.
            </i></p>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Smart Subgroups</strong></div>
            <i>Tag sound cues to different &quot;subgroups&quot; to control
            overlays. Cues in the same subgroup replace one another, while cues
            in different subgroups play concurrently.</i></p>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Individual Playback Controls</strong></div>
            <i>Each sound cue, whether playing or queued up, has individual
            controls for play, pause, seek, and loop. Complete control is at your
            fingertips.</i></p>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Hotkeys</strong></div>
            <i>Program keyboard shortcuts to frequently-used sound cues so you
            can play them instantly no matter where you are on the board. </i></p>
            <p>
            <div><strong>File Randomization</strong></div>
            <i>Attach multiple sound files to a single cue for randomized,
            non-repeating playback. Each time you hit the cue, a different file
            will play&mdash;for a more immersive experience.</i></p>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Scalable, Searchable, Tab-Based Interface</strong></div>
            <i>Handle dozens or even hundreds of sound cues in a project with
            Synthea&apos;s easy board layout. A
            global search is just a keypress away, so you can find any cue you
            want in seconds.</i></p>

    <div class="section-header">Why Synthea Exists</div>

    <div class="section-body">
        <p>
        In unscripted theater, a sound board operator needs to access effects
        and music in ways that scripted theater software simply can&apos;t handle.
        Programs like QLab and Show Cue Systems can be powerful when audio playback
        is carefully planned and played in sequence, but are too cumbersome for the
        unpredictable, seat-of-your-pants sound design of improvisation and
        unscripted theater.
        </p><p>
        As a tech improviser, I once needed the ability to engage in realtime,
        unscripted conversation
        between performers onstage and an &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;
        controlled by me in the booth. The AI&apos;s dialogue would need to be
        synthesized from pre-recorded sentence fragments, which would require
        software to assemble the cues
        on-the-fly and play them back seamlessly in real-time.
        <p>
        Unable to find any soundboard software capable of this task, I wrote
        the first version of Synthea to do just that. I immediately saw the value this software
        could provide beyond synthesizing dialogue, and since then
        Synthea has expanded to provide customized music and sound effects
        boards for dozens of other plays, variety shows, and improv performances around the world.
        </p><p>
        The software is still in its infancy, but for those ready to try it out,
        I hope Synthea proves to be a useful tool.
