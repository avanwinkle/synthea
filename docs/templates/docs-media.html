        <p>You can import media anywhere you see an <b>+ Add Media</b> button
        or icon (<md-icon class="material-icons">library_add</md-icon>), including on the cue
        editor, in the media manager, and on the bottom toolbar. Click the
        button/icon to open the file dialog and select one or more audio files.
        </p>

        <p>Imported media files are <u>copied</u> to the project&apos;s media collection,
        so it is safe to move or delete the originals. If the project already
        has a file of the same name, it will be overwritten.

        <p>On the left of the Media Manager you will see a list of all the
        media files in the project. Any files that have been copied to the
        project but haven&apos;t been assigned to cues will be listed under
        <b>Unassigned Media</b>, while all the files assigned to cues are
        listed under <b>Assigned Media</b>.

        <p>If a category has no cues, it will not be shown.</p>

        When you select a media file on the left, on the right will appear
        a details pane with additional information about the selected file,
        and an audio player where you can preview the track.

        Below the preview player will be a list of all the cues this media file
        is assigned to (if any), with the name of the cue and the page/section
        in which it appears. You can delete a cue by clicking on the delete icon
        (<md-icon class="material-icons">delete</md-icon>).
        </p>
        <p>
        If no cues are assigned to this media file, the <b>Delete Media</b>
        button will remove this media file from the project. Deleting the media
        file will reduce the disk size of your project but cannot be undone, so
        you&apos;ll need the original file if you want to add it back later.
