            Synthea is a customizable soundboard program designed for dynamic playback of sound effects, ambience, and music in unscripted environments. It was written for use in improvised theater, but
            is ideal for any live performance where pre-programmed cues won't cut it.

    <div class="section-header">What Synthea Does</div>

    <div class="section-body">
        <p>
        Synthea provides a tabbed software soundboard for realtime playback of sound effects, ambience, and music. It&apos;s easy-to-use interface
        makes it a quick solution to any live production, while it&apos;s powerful
        features provide deep customization and precision for advanced users.
        </p>
        <p>Some key features include:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Convenient Queuing</strong></div>
            <i>Line up sound cues in advance to play back when you need them&mdash;
            on demand, sequentially, or all at once.</i></p>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Automatic Crossfading</strong></div>
            <i>When a sound cue is paused or stopped, Synthea automatically fades the sound out so you don't have to worry about
            it. With realtime board toggles and optional cue-specific settings,
            you choose whether new cues fade in or start at full volume.
            </i></p>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Smart Subgroups</strong></div>
            <i>Tag sound cues to different &quot;subgroups&quot; to control
            overlays. Cues in the same subgroup replace one another, while cues
            in different subgroups play concurrently.</i></p>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Individual Playback Controls</strong></div>
            <i>Each sound cue, whether playing or in the queue, has individual
            controls for play, pause, seek, and loop. Complete control is at your
            fingertips.</i></p>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Hotkeys</strong></div>
            <i>Program keyboard shortcuts to frequently-used sound cues so you
            can play them instantly no matter where you are on the board.</i></p>
            <p>
            <div><strong>File Randomization</strong></div>
            <i>Attach multiple sound files to a single cue for randomized,
            non-repeating playback. Each time you hit the cue, a different file
            will play&mdash;for a more immersive experience.</i></p>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Scalable, Tab-Based Interface</strong></div>
            <i>Handle dozens or even hundreds of sound cues in a project with
            Synthea&apos;s easy board layout.</i></p>
        </blockquote>

    <div class="section-header">Why Synthea Exists</div>

    <div class="section-body">
        <p>
        In unscripted theater, a sound board operator needs to access effects and music in ways that scripted theater software simply can&apos;t handle.
        </p><p>
        As a tech improviser, I once needed the ability to engage in realtime, unscripted conversation
        between performers onstage and an &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; controlled in the booth. The AI&apos;s dialogue would need to be synthesized from pre-recorded sentence fragments, which would require
        software to assemble the cues
        on-the-fly and play them back seamlessly in real-time.
        <p>
        Unable to find any soundboard software capable of this work, I wrote Synthea to do just that. I immediately saw the value this software could provide beyond synthesizing dialogue, and since then
        Synthea has expanded to provide customized music and sound effects boards for numerous other
        unscripted plays and improv performances around the world.
        </p><p>
        It is still in its infancy, but for those willing to give it a shot, I hope Synthea proves to be a useful tool.
