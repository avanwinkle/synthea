        <p>Every cue can be configured with settings for display and playback
        defaults. The following options are available for every cue:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <div><strong>Cue Title</strong></div>
                The name of the cue, which will appear on the button and in
                the queue/playback track name.
            </p>
            <p>
                <div><strong>Subgroup</strong></div>
                If you assign this cue to a
                <a class="internal-link" scroll-to="sec-subgroups">subgroup</a>,
                when played it will fade out
                any other cues in the same subgroup. If this cue is playing and another
                cue in the same subgroup is played, this cue will fade out.
                <br/><br/>
                If you do not assign a subgroup this cue will play on top,
                regardless of what else is playing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <div><strong>Loop Cue</strong></div>
                You can set this cue to loop by default. You can always change
                the loop state of a playing cue on the playback interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                <div><strong>Fade In</strong></div>
                By default, cues will either fade in or start at full volume,
                depending on the board&apos;s current setting. Instead, you can
                specify that this specific cue should always (or never) fade in.
            </p>
            <p>
                <div><strong>Delete Cue (<md-icon class="material-icons">delete</md-icon>)</strong></div>
                You can click on the delete icon to remove a cue from the project.
                This will not affect any media files attached to the cue.
            </p>

<section id="sec-media" class="section">
    <div class="section-header">Assigning Media</div>

    <div class="section-body">

        <p>A cue will need at least one media file assigned in order to play.
        If multiple media files are assigned, one will play at random each time
        the cue is played (but the same one won&apos;t play twice in a row). If
        no media files are assigned, the button will be disabled in player mode
        or have a warning icon (<md-icon class="material-icons">warning</md-icon>) in editor mode.
        </p>


        <p>
            <div><strong>Cue Audio File(s)</strong></div>
            This area at the bottom of the cue editor lists the audio files
            assigned to the cue. You can
            remove an assigned file by clicking on the removal
            icon (<b>&times;</b>).
        </p>
        <p>
            <div><strong>Project Media</strong></div>
            Here you will see a list of all the media files in the project
            that can be assigned to the cue. Select a file and click
            <b>&lt;&lt; Assign File to Cue</b> to attach it (or double-click
            the file).
            <br/><br/>
            You can add new media files to the project by clicking on <b>+ Add Files</b>. <br><br/>
            <i>NOTE: Any files added in this way will be automatically assigned
            to the cue.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            <div><strong>Media Filter</strong></div>
            If your project has a lot of media files, you can use the
            filter box below the media list to find something. Type anything
            into the box to start filtering files by name.

<section id="sec-subgroups" class="section">
    <div class="section-header">Subgroups</div>

    <div class="section-body">

        <p>Synthea utilizes the concept of <i>subgroups</i> to manage concurrent
        playback of cues in a project that might utilize any combination of music,
        ambient audio, and discrete sound effects. If your project has a "board type"
        set, all new cues will default to that subgroup.</p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Concurrency</strong></div>
        By default, all cues want to play on top of one another, which works well
        for layering audio and creating dynamic soundscapes. Any cue without a
        subgroup will layer on top of other currently-playing cues
        (i.e. concurrency).
        </p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Exclusivity</strong></div>
        Some types of cues shouldn&apos;t be play on top of each other. For
        example, playing a music track should seamlessly <i>replace</i> the
        music track that&apos;s currently playing, and itself be replaced by
        another. There should only be one music track playing at any given time
        (i.e. exclusivity).
        </p>

        <p>
        Every Synthea subgroup creates an exclusivity set, so playing any cue
        in that subgroup will replace any currently-playing cues <i>in that same
        subgroup</i>. Cues in other subgroups, and cues without subgroups, will
        not be affected.
        </p>
