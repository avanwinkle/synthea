            <p>
                <div><strong>Project Name</strong></div>
                The name of your project, which will appear in the title bar and
                project menu. Short and sweet works best.
            </p>
            <p>
                <div><strong>Folder Name</strong></div>
                Synthea needs to make a folder to store all your project files in.
                No special characters or anything fancy, just a few letters. You
                won't ever see this in Synthea but you can see the folder on your
                computer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <div><strong>First Page</strong></div>
                Every project needs one page to start with. You can always add
                more pages and/or change this page&apos;s name later.
            </p>
            <p>
                <div><strong>Board Type</strong></div>
                The board type makes creating cues faster by setting a default
                subgroup to new cues. You can always change a cue&apos;s subgroup
                later.
            </p>

        <p>When you've filled out the above, click <b>Create Project</b>. Synthea
        will create the necessary files and folders for your new project and take
        you directly to editing.

    <div class="section-body">
        <p>You can add pages and sections to your project layout by clicking
        on the <b>+ Add Page</b> and <b>+ Add Section</b> buttons. There is no

        </p>

        <p>It is currently not possible to delete or re-order pages and sections,
        but that will come along soon.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <div><strong>Cue Title</strong></div>
                The name of the cue, which will appear on the button and in
                the queue/playback track name.
            </p>
            <p>
                <div><strong>Subgroup</strong></div>
                If you assign this cue to a subgroup, when played it will fade out
                any other cues in the same subgroup. If this cue is playing and another
                cue in the same subgroup is played, this cue will fade out.
                <br/><br/>
                If you do not assign a subgroup, this cue will play on its own
                regardless of what else is playing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <div><strong>Loop Cue</strong></div>
                You can set this cue to loop by default. You can always change
                the loop state of a playing cue on the playback interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                <div><strong>Fade In</strong></div>
                By default, cues will either fade in or start at full volume,
                depending on the board&apos;s current setting. Instead, you can
                specify that this specific cue should always (or never) fade in.
            </p>
            <p>
                <div><strong>Cue Audio File(s)</strong></div>
                This area lists the audio files attached to the cue. You can
                remove an attached file by clicking on the removal icon (<b>&times;</b>), or attach a file using the <b>Project Media</b> section.
            </p>
            <p>
                <div><strong>Project Media</strong></div>
                Here you will see a list of all the media files in the project
                that can be attached to the cue. Select a file and click <b>&lt;&lt; Add File to Cue</b> to attach it.
                <br/><br/>
                You can add new media files to the project by clicking on <b>+ Add Files</b>. <br><br/>
                <i>NOTE: Any files added in this way will be automatically attached
                to the cue.</i>

            <p>
                <div><strong>Delete Cue (<md-icon class="material-icons">delete</md-icon>)</strong></div>
                You can click on the delete icon to remove a cue from the project.
                This will not affect any media files attached to the cue.
